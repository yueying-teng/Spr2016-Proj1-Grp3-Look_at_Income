## Project: Analysis of 2013 American Community Survey data 

Term: Spring 2016, First project
Team Members: Bob Minnich, Yueying Teng, Yusen Wang, Tianhong Ding


Summary: In this project, we investigated the 2013 American Community Survey data and the affects of Location, Age, Sex, Race,Secondary Education, Disability, Work Hours and Travel Time on Personal Income.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Two choropleth maps: one is of average personal income against birth place and the other is against place of residence

- Density Plot Comparisons Between multiple races on Minutes Traveled to Work, Work Hours Per Week and Personal Income for both Male and female gender groups. 

- Statistical comparisons of races vs population statistics (means, averages, standard deviation) using survey weights adjusted data 

- Boxplot of income from different age groups  


#### Solidify inference from Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Linear regression to solidify inferences made from visual plots, which confirms the effects of race and sex on income within the United States.
